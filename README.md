# C# Tool for Generating MD5 Hashes in Base64

This C# tool enables users to input strings and receive their corresponding MD5 hashed values in Base64 representation. It provides a command-line interface for interaction.

## Functionality

1. **Input Prompt:** Upon execution, the tool prompts the user to input a string for hashing.

2. **Input Handling:** It accepts user input character by character, masking the input for privacy.

3. **Hash Generation:** Once the user submits the input, the tool computes the MD5 hash of the input string using UTF-8 encoding.

4. **Base64 Representation:** The resulting MD5 hash is converted into its Base64 representation.

5. **Display:** The Base64-encoded MD5 hash is displayed on the console as the output.

6. **Continual Operation:** The tool continuously prompts for input and generates corresponding Base64 MD5 hashes until manually terminated.
